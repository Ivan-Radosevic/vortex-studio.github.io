                I am a lifelong enthusiast for flight. I started early, building free-flight gliders and moving up to radio-control planes. I never built models from pre-made plans. For me, the fun part was in using my imagination to build something strange and new, and enjoying a big dose of trial-and-error learning. Later, through obtaining a master's in aeronautical engineering, my interests have focused into some specific areas, such as aircraft concept design, flight dynamics, and aerodynamic simulation models.<br> 
                <!--br>
                Needless to say, I try to leave some of my free time aside so that I can enjoy life the way "normal" people do.<br>
                <br>
                VORTEX TOOLS is my latest solo project, undergoing steady development. At the current stage, it can serve as a great learning tool for students, as well as a powerful asset for serious design work. Perhaps more importantly, it holds vast potential for further development. This can go in many directions. The CAD module can be expanded to broaden the scope of utilisation. The current set of flow solvers can be developed to include boundary layer models of varying complexity, leading to truly innovative developments and bridging the gap between "cheaper" panel methods and more sophisticated CFD tools.<br>
                Let me know if you are interested in joining me to realize this potential.-->
