          <p><b>VORTEX TOOLS</b> is under continuous development. At the current stage, it can serve as a great learning tool for students, as well as a powerful asset for serious design work. Perhaps more importantly, it holds vast potential for further development, which can be aimed in multiple directions: </p>

          <ul class="text-novo">
            <li>A user-firendly GUI would significantly lower the user entry barrier, increasing appeal to students, professionals and enthusiasts alike. The learning curve could be flattened by offering an "easy" mode with simplified functionality. This line of development would be the safest bet in terms of high product value and low development risk.</li>
            <li>The CAD module has a lot of room for expanding functionality, such as including movable control surfaces, rotating propellers, jet intakes and nozzles etc. Similarly, the flow solver suite can be expanded to include transonic and supersonic flows. These additions could vastly broaden the scope of utilisation and enable entry into the professional-grade market.</li>
            <li>The physical models behind the current suite of flow solvers can be developed to include boundary layer models of increasing sophistication, leading to truly innovative developments and bridging the gap between basic panel methods and high-grade CFD tools in terms of realism. This line of development can be characterized as "high risk, high reward" in view of its potential for technologically disruptive innovation.</li>
